Unofficial Social Badge for [DEV.to](https://dev.to/)

A social badge that pulls your reaction count for an article thatâ€™s been shared
on DEV.

## Installation and Usage

Add script at the end of `<body>` after all `<devto-badge>` tags.

_If you're using a template for your blog posts, I suggest adding this to the
template file for your blog posts - not your main site layout._ This will help
to reduce unnecessary API calls to [DEV.to](https://dev.to/).

```html
<devto-badge data-article-url="https://dev.to/benjaminjprice/introducing-the-dev-social-badge-1bc3"></devto-badge>
